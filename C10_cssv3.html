			<!-- Information about Teacup puppies -->
		<p>Teacup puppies are usually the "runt" of the litter.Teacup dogs usually come form many already-small dog breeds, including teacup Poodles, teacup Pugs, and teacup Yorkies. Other popular teacup breeds include Maltese, Pomeranians, and Shih Tzus. But sometimes the dogs chosen for breeding are small because of a birth defect or other medical conditions.</p>
